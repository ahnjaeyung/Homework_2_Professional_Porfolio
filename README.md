My professional portfolio webpage.  This webpage presents my name, recent picture, a biographical section about me, my work, and my contact information.  The header of this webpage includes a navigation bar with functional links for *About Me*, *Work*, and *Contact Me* that the user can click, and the UI will scroll to the corresponding section.  When clicked, the *Resume* link in the navigation bar will take the user to a downloadable pdf of my resume.

The *About Me* section includes a photo of me as well as a biographical background which details my name, career aspirations, what I am currently doing, my educational background, and my past work experiences.  The *Work* section includes three of my projects.  Each of these projects includes a title, an image of the project (when clicked, the user will be taken to the project's live link), a brief description of the project, and a link to the github repository.

The footer of this webpage contains the *Contact Me* section.  This section includes three functional links.  When clicked, the first link, *Email*, will open the user's default mail program and create a new message with the TO field filled out with my email address.  The second and third links, *GitHub* and *LinkedIn*, will take the user to my GitHub and LinkedIn pages respectively.

Media Query was used for this webpage to change the border color and font-family of the footer and header depending on the screen size of the device used to view this webpage.

This portfolio page was created using HTML and CSS.
